Brought to medical attention due to her brother’s significant history of liver disease including portopulmonary and hepatopulmonary syndrome and treatment necessitating liver transplant. Mother reports patient was generally well in infancy though noted her being fussy/irritable around 4-5 months. Due to brother’s significant history of liver disease, liver function tests were checked periodically in the patient and demonstrated elevated transaminases prompting further work up around 10 months of age. Liver U/S at that time reported “heterogeneous echotexture of the liver, presumably related to patient's known hepatitis\. She has an extensive work up by multiple specialists (see below) and an underlying etiology for her symptoms and her brother’s (recently deceased) have not been determined.\r\n\r\nAt 21 months she can crawl and pull to stand. She is not walking at this time. She understands basic commands. She is saying \mama\. \r\n \r\nLiver:“She has a complicated medical history that is significant for portal hypertension and hepatopulmonary syndrome. Her liver biopsy reveals lack of portal veins in sampled portal tracts and fibrosis. Despite an extensive work up, including genetic testing, we do not have a specific etiology for her liver fibrosis, abernathy picture and related cardiopulmomary sequelae.” \r\nCardiac: Was originally monitored as brother had history of hepatopulmonary syndrome and severe pulmonary hypertension. Patient admitted due to concern for increased pulmonary hypertension on echo now with dx of pulmonary hypertension and RV dysfunction (report improving with steroids). \r\nImmunology: Has been managed for her pulmonary hypertension with a combination of steroids and tacrolimus. Currently her steroids are on a taper and the goal is for her to be solely on a tacrolimus regimen of immunosuppression”. Some T-cell abnormalities, not currently explained. Would like to review WES results. \r\nNeuro: Patient was hospitalized. Initially admitted for fever, vomiting, URI symptoms and encephalopathy with the working diagnosis of HHV6 encephalitis vs. autoimmune/rheumatologic encephalitis. Neurology consulted for decreased movement in left arm. MRI brain 1/9/17 reportedly showed patchy and confluent white matter T2 signal abnormalities involving bilateral frontal, parietal and temporal white matter, splenium of the corpus callosum and brainstem, with diffusion restriction, nodular enhancement and hemosiderin deposition. Per Neurology, imaging was thought consistent with an acute hemorrhagic encephalitis superimposed on an underlying leukoencephalopathy. \r\nPulmonology: “From a pulmonary standpoint, she appears to have normal lung imaging (CXR and MRA), a normal pulmonary exam, and normal overnight oximetry - arguing against significant interstitial lung disease.” Will follow. \r\nHematology: Referred for thrombocytopenia. Per notes – not too clinically concerned about mild level of thrombocytopenia, would like to know etiology and if relates to other symptoms. Recommended testing for Bernard Soulier and MYH9. \r\nInfectious disease: Saw ID specialists to evaluate for liver transplant\r\n \r\nMRI MRA ABDOMEN W CONTRAST 1/18/2017 IMPRESSION: 1.  Cirrhotic liver morphology with stigmata of portal hypertension, including paraesophageal varices and splenomegaly. Patent hepatic arterial and venous vasculature. 2.  Bibasilar atelectasis with additional peripheral nodules, likely infectious or inflammatory in etiology when correlated with same day CT angiography of thorax. \r\n \r\nMRI BRAIN AND SPINE WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST 1/13/2017 IMPRESSION: 1.  Compared to MRI 1/9/2017, slightly increased extent of subcortical white matter lesions in the bilateral cerebrum and at the corpus callosum splenium.  Differential diagnostic considerations remain the same and include hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, vasculitis, leukodystrophy, or other metabolic or inflammatory processes. 2.  No spinal cord lesions visualized.\r\n
