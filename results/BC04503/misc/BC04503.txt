mild.2-3, faint.6th degree levo thoracic curvature, situs inversus.Refractory generalized epilepsy, epileptic encephalopathy, diplegia and language delay.\r\nOnset ~2.5 s/p fever, jerking noted 2x/day, abnormal EEG.  .Noted at the age of 6 years\r\nDevelopmental History:\r\n-Motor:\r\n-Gross: sat at 8 months, walked at 18 months, toe-walking, balance issues?  Getting AFOs, runs on tip-toes, poor coordination possibly weak\r\n-Fine: no issues\r\n- Cognitive:  \r\n· As of 5/24/17 puts 2-3 words together, started talking at age 2 years, doesn’t seem to understand many commands, points or goes and gets what wants, understands better than he can communicate\r\n· Special education\r\n- Social/emotional: makes good eye contact but may not understand very well what is said to him\r\n- Bladder: able to use toilet on own but wears diapers (doesn’t go on his own)\r\n- Bowel: able to use toilet on own but wears diapers (doesn’t go on his own)\r\n- Eating: poor eater, decreased appetite (possibly due to the medications)\r\n- Sleep: no issues\r\n\r\nTesting:  \r\n· Age 6 years: Xray spinal for scoliosis: 6th degree levo thoracic curvature, situs inversus\r\n· Age 6 years: pelvic Xray for diplegia, increased lower extremity tone: bilateral symmetric coxa valga\r\n· Age 4 years: abnormal EEG secondary to\r\n· Two electrographic generalized seizures with paroxysmal fast activity\r\n· During wakefulness very high amplitude multifocal epileptiform activity\r\n· Near continuous epileptiform activity consisting of generalized spikes, sharps, polyspikes and multifocal activity and paroxysmal activity during sleep with intermittent attenuations\r\n· Age 4 years: EEG: abnormal EEG secondary to:\r\n· Frequent generalized and multi-focal epileptiform discharges, notably activated by sleep\r\n· Disrupted background organization and excess slowing of a moderate degree\r\n· Poor sleep organization\r\n· Two electrographic (no overt clinical) seizures revealing paroxysmal fast activity seemingly triggered by photic stimulation at 10 and 16 Hz\r\n· Age 4 years: video EEG: abnormal EEG secondary to\r\n· Very frequent clinical and electrographic generalized seizures with paroxysmal fast activity and clinical behavioral arrest\r\n· During wakefulness very high amplitude very frequent multifocal epileptiform activity\r\n· Paucity of sleep organization\r\n· Near continuous epileptiform activity consisting of generalized spikes, sharps, polyspikes and multifocal activity and paroxysmal fast activity during sleep with intermittent attenuations\r\n· This EEG is consistent with an epileptic encephalopathy\r\n· Age 3 years:Epilepsy panel\r\n· KCNQ2: heterozygous VUS: c.2560C>T, p.Arg854Cys, autosomal dominant\r\n· NOTCH3: heterozygous VUS: c.509A>G, p.His170Arg, autosomal dominant\r\n· MLC1: heterozygous VUS: c.544G>A, p.Ala182Thr, autosomal recessive\r\n· PMM2: heterozygous VUS: c.8C>G, p.Ala3Gly, autosomal recessive\r\n· PDSS2: heterozygous VUS: c908A?G, p.Glu303Gly, autosomal recessive\r\n· 3 years: EEG: abnormal EEG secondary to sleep activated, focal epileptiform discharges from the R>>L temporal regions and intermittent focal slowing from the R posterior temporal region. There are no seizures.  Clinical correlation: focal epileptiform activity suggests an increased risk for partial onset seizures. Focal slowing may suggest an underlying region.   \r\n· 2 years: brain MRI without contrast: no focal intracranial abnormality identified\r\n· 2 years: EEG: abnormal EEG secondary to frequent, sleep and drowsy activated, paroxysmal runs of low voltage fast activity followed by voltage attenuation, sometimes accompanied by a rapid truncal body jerk and vocalization.  Clinical correlation: captured fast activity is considered an epileptiform equivalent and given the clinical accompaniment of body jerks, consideration to myoclonic or tonic/atonic seizures is recommended.  The overall pattern is compatible with a primary generalized epilepsy syndrome.\r\n· 2 years: CGH microarray: normal\r\n· 2 years: EEG: abnormal secondary to:\r\n· Diffusely increased theta and delta range activity\r\n· Poorly defined posterior dominant rhythm\r\n· Focal slowing over the right > left hemisphere\r\n· Frequent high amplitude multifocal epileptiform activity\r\n· Four generalized clinical seizures which electrographically had the appearance of  a tonic or atonic seizure\r\n· Clinical correlation: diffuse generalized slow activity reflects a diffuse but etiologically nonspecific disturbance of cerebral activity.  It is most commonly seen with various metabolic and toxic encephalopathies and varies with the severity of the encephalopathy.  Localized arrhythmic delta and theta activity is associated with locally disordered cerebral functioning.  This EEG suggests a tendency toward both and partial and generalized seizures\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
