Noted at age 9, requires a diaper..- This was reportedly seen in the neonatal period, however, Brain MRI at age 8 years: \Mildly dysmorphic ventricular system without evidence of hydrocephalus.\ .At age 7, she required glasses, but has trouble wearing them. .- Mildly upslanted fissures\r\n- Atypical arched eyebrows.-Started ~8 years.\r\n-Generalized, convulsive seizures.- Evaluated at 9 years: active, walking independently; no words or directed noises heard.\r\n- When evaluated at 7 years: Has been evaluated by regional center and parents were told they cannot rule out autism.\r\n- Walking at 2-3 years old age.\r\n- Learned to sit at 18 months.\r\n- Learned to roll over at 1 year of age..Required repair..Reduced white matter volume in the parahippocampal gyri is nonspecific, however no additional focal parenchymal abnormalities are present to correlate with the history of seizure. .Development:\r\n- Learned to roll over at 1 year of age.\r\n- Learned to sit at 18 months.\r\n- Walking at 2-3 years old age. \r\n\r\nVEEG:\r\nage 8 years\r\nIMPRESSION: This is a normal awake and asleep continuous video EEG\r\n \r\nBRAIN MRI age 8 years\r\nIMPRESSION:\r\n1.
