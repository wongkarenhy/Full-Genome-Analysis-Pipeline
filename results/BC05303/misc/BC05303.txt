Noted at age 11 years: \r\nPartial idiopathic epilepsy\r\n- seizures; Onfi; under control\r\n- EEGS abnormal in past\r\n- MRIs have shown mild hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, .Noted since 7 months, when he appeared \floppy\ to mother.\r\nNoted at age 11 years\r\n- understands mother\r\n- makes sounds, but has no words\r\n- follows instructions\r\n- not yet walking\r\n- has services in the school system\r\n- Angelman syndrome was considered as a diagnosis but methylation studies were negative\r\n- WES was performed two years ago\r\n- otherwise well apart from seizures.Mild hypoplasia of the corpus callosum..\Chromosome analysis, DNA array, CDG, lactate, fatty acid, mitochondrial point mutation analysis, urine organic acids, plasma, amino acids, carnitine profile, hormonal profile including FSH, LH and thyroid function, very long chain fatty acid, FISH or Prader-Willi and Angelman, fragile x, skeletal survey. The patient has had 3 head MRIs, and the most recent one was at 2.5 years. Both of these scans showed mild hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, but no other brain abnormalities.\\r\n\r\nEEG at approximately age 5 years: IMPRESSION: Abormal EEG during wakefulness and light sleep due to left posterior slowing and abundant epileptiform discharges at P3.\r\n \r\nEEG at approximately age 5.5 years: IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG during wakefulness and sleep due to abundant discharges at P3. This EEG recording is unchanged from prior.\r\n\r\nBrain MRI (at 10 mo) -\r\n1. Calvarium demonstrates a brachiocephalic configuration with parietal occipital plagiocephaly.\r\n2. Myelination is appropriate for patient age without evidence of underlying structural or parenchymal lesions.\r\n3. Infundibulum appears normal without definitive evidence for suprasellar pathology. However, careful correlation with endocrine function warranted as numerous presumed artifacts are noted within the suprasellar cistern.
