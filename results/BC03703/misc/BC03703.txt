\thick gums\.simple ear helices.A recent EEG showed continued epilepsy and abnormalities .{Reported at 6 years He only says \yeah\ and babbles. He walked at age 4 and is only now getting more stable. Feeding was a challenge due to choking; improved but pureed baby foods. Gross motor delay. Lots of immature behaviors, like no appreciation of danger. He does understand speech, follows \r\ninstructions (go get certain toy).\r\n\r\nPer Neurologist at age 6 years: \r\nMonosyllabic vocalizations.\r\nHolds mouth open, some mild drooling. \r\nHolds head to the side. No commands.\r\nEOMI. Inconsistent regard, tracking.\r\nNo motor asymmetry; at least antigravity in both arms and legs.\r\nDTRs 2+/symmetric.\r\nGait somewhat unsteady.

In toe-ing but can lift feet.Per Dr. Mendelsohn at age 6 years} An MRI this month was normal except for “mildly globular appearance of bilateral hippocampi posteriorly, left greater than right” and a recent EEG showed posterior epileptiform discharges, myoclonic seizures and diffuse cerebral slowing. He seems to understand his parents well and there is no clear evidence for severe hearing loss.\r\nBrain MRI (6 years): No definite structural abnormality to suggest seizure etiology. \r\nEEG (6 years): 1. Diffuse slowing of cerebral activity for age 2. Frequent generalized posterior predominant epileptiform \r\ndischarges 3. Frequent myoclonic seizures
