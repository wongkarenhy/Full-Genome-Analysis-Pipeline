Hyperammonemia (peak 79 umol/L in our system), .At 9 months elevated CK (peak 2630 in our system.Leg length discrepancy: has femoral anteversion R < L by 1 cm, orthotics recommended, not obtained as insurance not approved, still falling - 4-5 times per day, more if she is wearing shoes, also c/o pain in hip once every other week. .Noted at 14 months: CT head: 9 months: normal. \r\n \r\nECHO:9 months Summary: \r\n1. No structural defects identified. \r\n2. Normal left ventricular systolic function. \r\n \r\nUS ABDOMEN COMPLETE 9 months \r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n1. No abdominal abnormality. \r\n2. Left pleural effusion. \r\n \r\n9 months: \r\nCarnitine: free 7.9 (18-58 umol/L) \r\nAcylcarnitines: C14:1: 2.20 (0.01-0.34) also mild elevations in C14:2, C14, C14OH, C16:1,C18.. Strongly suggestive of VLCADD. \r\nUrine organic acids: lactic aciduria, ketonuria, elevated octenedioic and decenedioic strongly suggestive of VLCADD. \r\nMMA: normal 0.11 \r\nHomocysteine: 3 (3-10). Normal. \r\nPlasma amino acids: normal. \r\nUrine orotic acid: normal. \r\n \r\n9 months: \r\nAcylcarnitine: elevated C2 (free carnitine due to supplementation) otherwise normal. \r\n \r\n9 months: \r\nACADVL gene sequencing and del/dup at GeneDx: \r\nNegative. \r\n \r\n9 months: VLCAD enzyme assay : \r\nHeterozygous range: low normal at 3.7 (3.7-8.6)\r\n \r\nCBC, LFT, BMP, iron studies are reviewed from 1 year:\r\nWBC 18.3 \r\nCa++ 11.1\r\notherwise all normal. \r\n\r\n\r\nNoted at age 3 years: has a h/o hyperammonemia (peak 79 umol/L in our system), ketosis and lactic acdosis with elevated CK (peak 2630 in our system - 11/17/2014), suggestive of a fatty acid oxidation disorder. ACP was consistent with VLCADD, but DNA sequencing was negative.  The etiology of her sxs is unknown, her brother has also had rhabdomyolysis and has developmental delay and seizures. Another brother died at 8 months of age in a vomiting illness. She has had WES with mt DNA which identified her to be a carrier of an MCAD mutation (paternal).\r\n \r\nIn the interim since last seen she was admitted to the hospital for a paronychia which required I and D and a UTI. Laboratories were normal. Mother was concerned that she is falling, at our last visit, this is worse now, she is falling 10 times per day, increased from six. She was seen by rehabilitative medicine and she was referred to a specialist for manipulation.  Was given AFOs but is not wearing these.  She seems to be falling more as she is more active.\r\n\r\nNoted at 4 years (Neurology): \r\nGross motor development: Rolling over 4 mo; sitting up 6 mo; then around 8 months was already pulling to stand but after her intercurrent illness had some slowing in gross motor and language; walking 14-15 mo.\r\nLanguage/cognition: Babbling 7, 8 months (mama, papa); then slowed down after her illness; around 18 months she started again to say single words. Only started to build 2-3 word sentences around age 3.  Currently still has some difficulties with pronunciation of certain sounds like \r\.\r\nToilet training  3 years. \r\nFine motor skills: hand preference: no early onset; reach for toys 3-4 mo; transfer: 6-7 mo; pincer grasp: around 12-13 mo; scribble: not yet.  \r\nSocial/Adaptive skills: Imaginative play at  4 years;  Eye contact normal 2-3 weeks, social smile: 4-5 months. Very social with other children.\r\nDevelopmental regressions: none\r\nReceiving therapies: no.
