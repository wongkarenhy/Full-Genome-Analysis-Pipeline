Suggested to be related to some food allergies..At 3 years: Global delays. Still working on walking unassisted. Says a few words like \ma.\ Patient is sitting up again but has not been able to stand again. His mother worries he is having more developmental difficulties.\r\n .Multiple hyperammonemic episodes requiring hospitalization. Cobalamin B type..Placed at 1 year of life. .\Cushingoid\ per MD.Patient was first symptomatic at 3 days of life with altered mental status and hypoglycemia. He was diagnosed with Cobalamin B-type MMA and the chart refers to a homozygous mutation in MMAB. Past notes also indicate he is not B12 responsive based on prior trials; however, there was a decrease in MMA levels on very high dose (10mg) IM hydroxycobalamin and his metabolic geneticist is considering restarting B12.\r\n \r\nSince diagnosis, he has been admitted \at least a dozen time.\ He is usually decompensated and acidotic at the time of admission, rather than prophylactic admissions for viral infections.\r\n\r\n--2 y.o. male here for evaluation by Genetics for MMA (CblB). The purpose of this visit is to establish care with the expectation that he will undergo a liver transplant.\r\n \r\nHe is quite delayed and small for age, with numerous decompensated admissions. We discussed that liver transplant can improve control in MMA and reduce the frequency and severity of decompensation, though it does not \cure\ MMA and the patient would still need ongoing management by his metabolic physician.\r\n \r\nHis physician has concern that patient has another diagnosis. He has very mildly dysmorphic features and it is difficult to say, meeting him the first time, if his small size and microcephaly are due to prolonged difficulty with MMA/diet management or another syndrome. Given parental consanguinity, additional testing would be reasonable and is deferred to his primary providers.\r\n\r\nLiver transplant (at -2 years, 9 months)for MMA (CblB-type) complicated by hyperammonemia, lactic acidosis, tremors, and embolic strokes.\r\n
