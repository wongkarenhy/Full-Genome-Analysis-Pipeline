I think this is serum elevated transaminases .Patient history includes elevated transaminases, myoglobinuria and ketosis with emesis and lethargy noted at age 1-year. First episode was after MMR vaccination when she developed fever and a rash, symptoms progressed to decreased appetite, vomiting and lethargy. At the time she was admitted, her blood sugar was normal but AST was 1629 U/L (nl 22-63) and ALT was 1080 U/L (nl 30-65); bilirubin and coagulations factors were normal. Bicarb was slightly low at 19 and there was a normal anion gap. She was treated with IVFs with 5% dextrose 0.45% NS and KCl 20 mEq/L. Her second hospitalization was at age 18-month-old; during this episode she was noted to be hypoglycemic (BS 50) with 2+ketones on UA, ammonia was normal at 19, lactic acid was wnl at 1.9, free fatty acids were elevated at 1.75 (nl <1.5), beta-hydroxyburitic and AST/ALT (53/31) were within normal. She was treated with IVFs with D10 and IV carnitine.\n\nAt the age of 2 years she developed an acute viral illness with high fever and irritability. Upon admission she appeared more listless and began not taking PO. She was noted to have elevated LFTs (peak AST/ALT 609/463) with no cholestasis, there was no hypoglycemia, ammonia was mildly elevated at 47 and CK was normal at 105. During that hospitalization her parents indicate \she did not move or talk for 1 week\. On HD#4 she suffered a metabolic stroke while recovering from her illness. That day she had lost IV access and had poor PO intake and went on to develop abnormal eye movements, eyes rolled back, rigid, arched back, sudden onset left facial drooping and right hemiplegia. Due to concern for seizures she was moved to the PICU and pertinent imaging studies included a head CT on 7/16 that revealed a focal hypodensity within the right thalamus and additional regions of hypodensity vs artifact extending from the midbrain into the posterior pons. A brain MRI on 7/19 showed ischemic signal changes in the parahippocampal gyrus, corpus callosum, right thalamus, dorsal midbrain and pons and around the lateral ventricles as well as the cerebellar hemispheres. Additionally there were evolving EEG abnormalities consistent with left hemispheric stroke associated with multifocal or diffuse encephalopathy. She had muscle and skin biopsies for diagnostic purpose.. Liver biopsy was not performed. She had a normal ECHO by report, and an eye exam. per her mother, though these are not seen in the medical records. She has regained skills, but continued to have L ptosis, intermittent vertical nystagmus, dysarthria she regained the ability to walk independently although steady in about 3 months later. After the stroke parents report patient has had issues with motor planning, she is unsteady, her right eye is turning inward, she does not track horizontally and her left hand is not fully functional. \n\n{At age 3 years patient had an illnessthat lasted about 2 weeks. It was noticed when patient was picked up from school and soon after she became very lethargic. She had a fever of about 101 degrees Farenheit which lasted about 5 days. Her mother reports that she \couldn't tell if she was asleep or not\. She was treated with Motrin and Solcarb which improved her symptoms, and she was syringe-fed bone broth. She developed URI symptoms of runny nose and cough.\n\nNoted in report from when patient was 3.5 years balance has been an ongoing issue. She currently falls about 12x/day, but her parents note that this has been improving. She receives OT and PT each once a week through CCS and speech therapy at her preschool. She is in an integrated class with an IEP. Her mother reports that she has anxiety in the classroom that has been classified as PTSD. She cries when there is commotion in the classroom.\n\nPatient has motor deficiencies including nystagmus, amblyopia, lagophthalmos, right VI nerve palsy and horizontal saccadic paresis.\n\nTesting:\nQuantitative PCR for mtDNA depletion: Negative\nSoutherblot for mtDNA deletions/rearrangement: Negative, no deletions detected din mtDNA\nTargeted resequencing of mtDNA: Negative for know pathogenic mutations in mtDNA\nMitochondrial Enzymes - Muscle: Negative for mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme deficiency\nCoenzyme Q10 levels - Muscle: Negative for coenzyme Q10 deficiency. \nResequencing of mtDNA: Negative for know pathogenic mutations in mtDNA. \nWES and WES re-anayslis: Negative.\n\nRadiology & Imaging Studies:\nCT 1 year, 11 months: Focal hypodensity within the right thalamus and additional regions of hypodensity vs artifact extending from the midbrain into the posterior pons. \n\nBrain MRI 1 year, 11 months: Ischemic signal changes in the parahippocampal gyrus, corpus callosum, right thalamus, dorsal midbrain and pons and around the lateral ventricles as well as the cerebellar hemispheres.\n\nDEVELOPMENT:\nSocial smile: 2-3 months\nRoll: 4 months\nSit: 6 months\nWalk: 10 months\nFirst word: \dog\ 9-10 months\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
