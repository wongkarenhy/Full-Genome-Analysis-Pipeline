\relative microecphaly\\r\nNoted at age 3 years His head size plots within the normal range, but in comparison to the rest of his body measurements, he has relative microcephaly..Noted at age 3 years: He walked around 17 months, though his gait continues to appear unstable and he falls frequently. He runs, but somewhat unsteady, and he can now hop.\r\n{He was able to feed himself at 18 months, now uses a fork and is learning to use a knife. He does not know numbers beyond 1-2-3 and does not know his letters beyond the letter E. He speaks in phrases, but only has two word phrases that are not completely intelligible, even to his parents.  He frequetly expresses frustration about the fact that others do not understand him, and this causes him to act out aggressively towards his family, teachers and peers at school.   His parents have been trying to potty train, unsuccessfully.\r\n .Noted at age 3 years There was a period of speech regression sometime around the age of 2 yo when his mother was pregnant with his younger sister. At that time he had several words, which he lost and took a very long time to regain..At age 4 years: Pt with h/o developmental delay and dysmorphic features with ongoing evaluations by Neurology and Genetics. Had MRI at age 3, almost 4 years} and changes in the basal ganglia identified, these were suggestive of acute stroke, and he was admitted and given empiric management for possible missed (on newborn screen) organic acidemia and intercurrent illness actue stroke; organic acids obtained in that hospitalization indicated that he did not have either PA or GA1 and his neuro exam was stable - no new focal deficits, dystonia, new onset movement disorder.  He was discharged on low dose biotin and high dose thiamine for possible SLC19A3 deficiency, with a plan to obtain MRI with MRA for possible Moya-Moya. This planned study was cancelled after further review indicated that this was unlikely. He was seen in follow-up and he will be seen again in three months. Genetic testing was sent to look for a mutation in SLC19A3 which returned negative for any mutations.  \r\n \r\nHe remains on biotin and B1, parents are paying for this, it costs about 60 dollars per month.  He has improved in speech and motor skills per parents.  \r\n \r\nAn array was abnormal with XYY karyotype, this does not explain his BG changes.\r\n\r\nMr Brain Without Contrast\r\nResult Date: age 3 years\r\n1.  Findings suggestive of basal ganglia injury of different ages and specifically the bilateral putamina and the right caudate head. This distribution is suggestive of an underlying metabolic abnormality. //Impression 1 discussed with Dr. Greene (Pediatric Neurology) on 4/26/2018 12:08 PM.//  Report dictated by: Emily Amos Edwards, MD, signed by: Christine M Glastonbury, MBBS Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging
