Found to be light averse, with moderate hyperopia and astigmatism. Unclear if visual impairment is delayed visual maturation vs cerebral visual impairment vs retinal/macular disorder. Dilated fundus exam revealed normal optic nerves and small flat, hypopigmented retinal lesions temporal to the fovea in both eyes. .\Dysconjugate gaze\.Gross motor (6 years, summarized by Neurologist):\r\n-Cannot walk or sit up or roll\r\n-Fine motor: has to be fed\r\n-Language: Expressive - coos, nonverbal, Receptive - none\r\n-Social/Adaptive: no purposeful smiling or laughing\r\n-Hearing: none\r\n-Vision: cortical blindness\r\n-Sleep: no problems\r\n-Behavior: no problems\r\n-Regression: No .Sleep lab study (as a newborn): Interpretation: The patient has mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea with normal gas exchange. The central apnea present is physiologic. The patient's control of breathing appears to be normal. The patient had an apneic and bradycardic event during wakefulness that was associated with airway obstruction and that resolved with stimulation..Brain MRI: decrease in white matter volume with a thinned corpus callosum, thin brainstem and suggestion of mild hypomyelination. Findings suggest a metabolic or genetic disorder. On follow-up, it is recommended that spectroscopy be performed with a short echo time (26 ms) to better evaluate for underlying metabolic disorder..- POSSIBLE \tonic seizures\\r\n- Onset 3-4 years\r\n- Stiffens up his whole body for 10 seconds\r\n- Frequency: 6-7x/day, often heralding a cluster of spasms\r\n.- Began at 6-8 months (reports vary). \r\n- EEG consistent with infantile spasms.\r\n- Yells, jerks head and body forward, happens in - clusters, around sleep-wake transitions.\r\n- Frequency: everyday, a couple a day.(Infancy) due to urinary tract infection..Seizures 4-5x day, cries, flexes body, arms toward midline\r\nSometimes sleepy afterwards\r\nMore with going to sleep or waking up\r\n-hypsarrhythmia\r\n-admitted for infantile spasms\r\n-epilepsy genetic panel was not revealing\r\n-developmental delay\r\n-SLC2A1 variant
