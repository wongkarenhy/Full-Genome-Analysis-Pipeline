History of depression/anxiety.Endonasal transsphenoidal resection of a left pituitary microadenoma with expected post-operative changes..- MADD (multiple acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency) / glutaric aciduria type II\r\n- Dx based on increased glutaric acid, ethylmalonic acid in urine as well as elevated hexanoylglycine in urine. Skin biopsy was obtained for enzyme testing, due to a problem growing the cells the results were inconclusive. Sequencing and deletion/duplication analysis was performed for all three genes known to be involved in MADD: ETFA, ETFB, and ETFDH.  Results identified a heterozygous pathogenic variant, c.1773_1774delAT in ETFDH, which is a truncating variant reported in individuals with MADD.  A second disease causing mutation was not identified but is presumed to be present and undetectable by the test that was performed..Progressive.Mother and other female relatives with reported fatigue..Has a h/o progressive myopathy and developed acute rhabdomyolysis at the age of 32.  She was hospitalized and testing was sent identifying glutaric aciduria type II, or MADD via analytes: increased glutaric acid, ethylmalonic acid in urine as well as elevated hexanoylglycine in urine. Skin biopsy was obtained for enzyme testing, due to a problem growing the cells in the lab this was repeated and is reported as normal. \r\n\r\nDNA testing showed one mutation in ETF-DH, the other was not identified by sequencing or by deletion duplication analysis. Sequencing and deletion/duplication analysis was performed for all three genes known to be involved in MADD: ETFA, ETFB, and ETFDH.  Results identified a heterozygous pathogenic variant, c.1773_1774delAT in ETFDH, which is a truncating variant reported in individuals with MADD.  A second disease causing mutation was not identified but is presumed to be present and undetectable by the test that was performed. DNA testing was repeated at another laboratory, an alternate possibility is a defect in a B2 transporter, a research genome test is being performed through CIAPM.\r\n\r\n{From CIAPM presentation}:\r\n- Onset of progressive weakness and dyspnea on exertion at approximately 31 years of life.\r\n– Intermittently elevated CK (400-700); normal EMG\r\n– Workup for tachy: sleep study showing OSA \r\n- Started using CPAP at night \r\n–Endocrinology workup: pituitary microadenoma(IF)\r\n– Wheel chair use due to progressive weakness\r\n- Acute decompensation at 32 years: rhabdomyolysis (CK 3-4K), lactic acidosis, elevated LFTs requiring intubation\r\n-Biochemical pattern consistent with MADD\r\n–increased glutaricacid, ethylmalonic acid (400 RR < 20) in urine as well as elevated hexanoylglycinein urine\r\n-Fibroblast enzyme assay inconclusive\r\n\r\nPast surgical history that includes wisdom tooth extraction and transphenoidal / transnasal hypophysectomy / resection pituitary tumor.\r\n\r\nAdverse effect of anesthesia: Prolonged wake up after wisdom teeth extraction, anxious.\r\n\r\n
