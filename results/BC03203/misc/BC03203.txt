Noted at 4 weeks Newborn screen positive for TRECs, indicating low T cells. \r\n\r\nNoted at 4 monthsPatient has had a normal microarray and large immunodeficiency gene panel, neither of which has been diagnostic. She remains dependent on G-CSF and there is a real possibility she will require a bone marrow transplant in order to provider her with a functional immune system. However, it would be preferable to proceed to transplant with a diagnosis, as this diagnosis may inform the need, timing, and other aspects of the transplant, as well as the long-term prognosis and possibility of involvement of other systems besides the bone marrow. \r\n\r\nCrawling at 9 months - parents not concerned about development.
