\Small epicanthal folds.\.- liver biopsy showed an obstructive biliary disease pattern\r\n- now s/p deceased donor liver transplant at 5 months\r\n- WES resulted with VUS in SREBF1 which was paternally inherited\r\n.At 2 months of life.- Grade III\r\n.Faint capillary hemangiomas over forehead and nape of neck..above lip and on upper back.Liver biopsy (at 2 months of life): The liver biopsy provides 9 portal tracts for evaluation. There is minimal lymphocytic portal inflammation and a marked ductular reaction. Bile ducts are present in most portal tracts (confirmed with CK7 stain). Scattered staining of hepatocytes is also seen on CK7 stain supporting a biliary etiology. The hepatic parenchyma does not show significant lobular inflammation, hepatocellular injury or steatosis. There is prominent hepatocanalicular cholestasis and ductular cholestasis. The trichrome stain shows extensive bridging fibrosis with occasional nodules. The iron stain is essentially negative. The PAS-D stain does not show cytoplasmic globules to suggest alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency.\r\n\r\nThe histologic findings show an obstructive biliary disease pattern, which can be seen in biliary atresia and other diseases that can affect the large bile ducts such as inspissated bile syndrome, cystic fibrosis and neonatal sclerosing cholangitis. Metabolic conditions like alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and progressive intrahepatic familial cholestasis (PFIC) type 3 can also lead to this picture. Other etiologies like congenital infections (such as CMV) and Zellweger syndrome can be evaluated clinically, but are less likely based on the histologic findings. \r\n\r\nThe patient has abnormal facies and the possibility of Alagille syndrome has been raised. Although bile ducts are not clearly identified in some portal areas, most portal tracts have interlobular bile ducts and there is no definite ductopenia in this biopsy. Bile ductular reaction is unusual for Alagille syndrome. Since bile duct loss may not be evident before 6 months of age and unusual findings like prominent ductular reaction can occur in some cases, this possibility cannot be excluded based on histologic grounds alone.\r\n\r\nLiver transplant at 6 months. \r\n\r\nSkeletal survey: normal.
