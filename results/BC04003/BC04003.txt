Documented at age 15 years Patient just returned from outside evaluations Dad reports that they were told that they saw findings similar to what was seen in sister. They state that the procedure performed by GI and CT imaging was not diagnostic and that they didn't get to complete testing. Discharge summary provided by the parents show that they had difficulty with catheter placement for manometry which limited testing. CT of the abdomen \showed no frank obstruction, normal aorto-mesenteric angle but borderline/low aorta-SMA distance\ but was limited by \presence of enteric tube which may have decompressed the stomach and duodenum.\ They felt those findings were most consistent with SMA syndrome, but noted that dilatation of the proximal jejunum consistent with history of colonic dysmotility was seen. Her colonoscopy showed a dilated colon. Manometry demonstrated poor colonic motility.\r\n\r\nDocumented at age 15 years Development has been normal. Waked at 10 months.
